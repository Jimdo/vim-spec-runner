# Vim Spec-Runner

Vim Spec-Runner is a Vim plugin to execute rspec and cucumber tests from inside an opened test file in Vim.

## Installation

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend installing vundle, add `Bundle 'Jimdo/vim-spec-runner'` to your vimrc and then:

* either within Vim: `:BundleInstall`
* or in your shell: `vim +BundleInstall +qall`
